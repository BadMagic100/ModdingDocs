# Dependency Mods
There are many dependency mods that were created to make modding easier. Below you can find a list of them.

### Satchel
A core mod made by Dandy and Mulhima.  
Some of the core features are:
- BetterMenus: An easier way to implement ICustomMenuMod.
  - Only asks the user to return a list of all the menu elements they want while the menu builder and such are abstracted away.
  - Provides events and methods that allows you to edit/hide elements at runtime.
- Others (TODO: Dandy)
