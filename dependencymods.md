# Dependency Mods

There are many dependency mods that were created to make modding easier. Below you can find a list of them.

## Satchel

A core mod made by Dandy and Mulhima.  
Some of the core features are:

- BetterMenus: An easier way to implement ICustomMenuMod.
  - Only asks the user to return a list of all the menu elements they want while the menu builder and such are abstracted away.
  - Provides events and methods that allows you to edit/hide elements at runtime.
- Others (TODO: Dandy)

## [SFCore](https://github.com/SFGrenade/SFCore)

A core mod made by SFGrenade.  
Some of the core features are:

- Helpers: Easier ways to simply add miscellaneous content.
  - E.g. achievements, charms, enviroment particles, items, menu styles and title logos.
  - Provides events and methods that allows you to add your content.
- Generic mod classes
  - This abstracts code used to have global and save settings.
- ModInterOp
  - This allows mods to register methods with a name so other mods can call them without having a hard dependency.
- MonoBehaviours
  - These are usefull for making custom scenes.
  - Abstract generation of Hollow Knight's MonoBehaviours for simple use.
    - Some of these require editor scripts to be easily usable.
- Util
  - Miscellaneous utils like FsmUtil, MiscCreator, SpriteUtil, USceneUtil and Util.
