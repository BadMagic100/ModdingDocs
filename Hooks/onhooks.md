# On Hooks

### Immediate TODO
- Show common hooks
- Explain best practices
  - like importance of calling orig(self) 
  - when to not call orig(self)
- Some examples from real mods


### Eventual TODO
Todos that are not important but could be done after most of the docs are finished
- Explanation of order of execution of multiple mod using on hooks (this is here because im not knowledgeable about it)
- Show how to hook using reflection (for orig_Methods) 
  - because it allows you to edit methods that are assembly edited by mapi
